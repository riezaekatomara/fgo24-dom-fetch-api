## 📝 Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Fetch API to retrieve and display data from external sources. It was created as part of the Front-End learning module in the FGO24 (Full-stack Generasi GIGIH Online 2024) bootcamp. The application showcases modern JavaScript techniques for handling asynchronous operations and DOM manipulation to present API data in an engaging user interface.

## ✨ Features

- Asynchronous data fetching from external APIs
- Dynamic content rendering using DOM manipulation
- Error handling for network requests
- Loading states and user feedback
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Clean and modern UI presentation of API data
- Implementation using vanilla JavaScript without additional libraries
- Live-server for faster development

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Fetch API, Promises/Async-Await)
- Live-server

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (to run live-server)
- Text editor (recommended: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## 🚀 How to Use

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riezaekatomara/fgo24-dom-fetch-api.git
cd fgo24-dom-fetch-api
```

### Running the Project

1. Install live-server if you don't have it already:

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

2. Run live-server in the project directory:

```bash
live-server
```

3. A browser will automatically open with the application running at `http://localhost:8080`

## 📱 Data Display

The application fetches data from an external API and dynamically displays it in the browser. Users can interact with the data through various UI elements such as filters, search functionality, or pagination depending on the implementation.
